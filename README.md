# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project we demonstraded two possibilities of Azure Marchine Learning. We have used Automated ML throught the Azure Machine Learning Studio to upload a 
dataset and set up a Automated ML run using purelly the UI which is more user friendly. We run all the steps necessary to set up the project, publish and consume the model.
In the second approach, it was created a pipeline using Azure Machine Learning. For this porpouse, it was used Azure Machine Learning SDK to set 
all the parameters necessary to run the model, set everything such,objective column, metrics, environment settings and so on. In the end the pipeline has been published as well. 
The published pipeline can be used by another pipelines or projects. A pipeline is a set of steps which may include data preparation, featurezation, training, deploy, tests, in summary
all that is need in a ML project. The good thing so, is that pipelines can be reusable. This is differente from a Automated ML Project, which can be a part of Pipeline.

## Project future improvements
As future improvements, there are not so much that can be done with this project, but, some tips could be, invest time to investigate all the features
and run some descritive statistics to find out how important are all the features. Try to select the best ones, as weel create another features. 
Also, a more detaild Automated ML can be run testing much more scenarios and also Deep Learning algorithms in attempt to find the best model.
